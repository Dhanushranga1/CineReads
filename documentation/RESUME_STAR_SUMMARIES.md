Implemented **multi-tier file-based caching system** reducing API costs by 70% and response times by 60%. Integrated **3 external APIs** (Hardcover GraphQL, TMDB REST) with **async/await patterns** and exponential backoff retry logic. Designed **TypeScript type-safe** frontend with **Framer Motion** animations and **Tailwind CSS** responsive UI. Deployed on **Vercel** (frontend) and **Render** (backend) with automated health checks.

**Result:** Achieved **<3 second average response time** for recommendations, **B+ code quality score**, comprehensive **Pydantic data validation**, and **85% reduction in cold-start latency** through intelligent caching strategies.
